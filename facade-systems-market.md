<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Facade Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ventilated Facade Systems</li><li>Non-Ventilated Facade Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Facade systems are categorized into ventilated and non-ventilated types based on their design and airflow capabilities. Ventilated facade systems allow air circulation between the building's outer cladding and insulation layer, promoting temperature regulation and moisture control. This enhances energy efficiency and durability. In contrast, non-ventilated facade systems offer a more rigid structure, focusing on aesthetic appeal and protection from weather elements but may have limited breathability. Both types cater to different architectural needs and environmental considerations.</p></p>
